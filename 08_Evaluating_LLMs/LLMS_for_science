My area of research lies in the Materials science field. I have not found a good idea for using LLMs in that field. However, LLMs can be of great use for Chemistry. In particular, the models can be used to predict the results of chemical reactions. It can further be used to describe the reaction paths, allowing not only to predict the outcomes of the reaction but also the transition reaction and intermediate components. In this case, reaction components can be used as tokens. Another way is to use elements as tokens and reaction components as some sort of phrases. Conditions of reaction can be described in words and used as supporting information for predicting reaction outcomes. PubChem could be used as a source for training being one of the largest largest libraries for chemical information. As a metric for the evaluation, BLEU can be used since the problem is like n-gram. Additionally, a model that uses text information to support prediction can use Human evaluation to assess the quality of LLM's result. This approach can successfully predict new reaction pathways but can also suffer from potential bottlenecks of Math equation solving described in the lecture. The model can be further extended with automatic lab approaches existing nowadays to test reactions predicted by the LLM in real laboratory conditions, correcting itself on the fly. Finally, the model can be trained to distinguish new reactions and ones existing in the literature. For the one existing in the literature, the model should provide appropriate citations. This in particular can be later checked by expert evaluation.
