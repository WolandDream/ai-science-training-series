Epochs tests
learning_rate = 0.05; epochs = 5; batch_size = 8; test_batch_size = 80
Accuracy on test set: 98.32%
learning_rate = 0.05; epochs = 10; batch_size = 8; test_batch_size = 80
Accuracy on test set: 98.22%
learning_rate = 0.05; epochs = 20; batch_size = 8; test_batch_size = 80
Accuracy on test set: 77.70%
For learning rate 0.05 the optiman number of epochs for training is 5 and 10. For 20 epochs training we see effect of overfitting.

Learning rate tests
learning_rate = 0.005; epochs = 10; batch_size = 8; test_batch_size = 80
Accuracy on test set: 98.50%
learning_rate = 0.0005; epochs = 10; batch_size = 8; test_batch_size = 80
Accuracy on test set: 93.67%
The optimal learning rate is 0.005. It increases performance for 10 epochs. The learning rate 0.0005 is too low and the resulting model is undertrained

Batch size tests
learning_rate = 0.005; epochs = 10; batch_size = 16; test_batch_size = 80
Accuracy on test set: 97.86%
learning_rate = 0.005; epochs = 10; batch_size = 4; test_batch_size = 80
Accuracy on test set: 98.74%
The optimal batch size is 4 in combination with lr 0.004 ensuring that weights of the model are adjusted more often.
